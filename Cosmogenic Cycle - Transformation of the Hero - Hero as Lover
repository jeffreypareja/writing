Something that freed from the restraints is symbolized as a woman

eg. hegemony wrested from enemy, 
freedom won from malice of monster
life energy released from the toils of tyrant Holdfast

woman is maiden of innumerable dragon slayings, bride abducted
from jealous father, virgin rescued from unholy lover

she is the "other portion" of the hero-himself - for "each is both" 
if his stature is that of world monarch she is the wrold, if she is 
a warrior she is fame

the woman is the image of his destiny which he is to release from
prison of enveloping circumstance

but if he is ignorant of his destiny, or deluded by false considerations
hence no effort on his part will overcome obstacles

motif of difficult task as prerequisite to the bridal bed has spun
the hero deeds of all time and all the world.

the tests imposed are difficult beyond measure. 
they seem to represent an absolute refusal,
when a fit candidate appears, no task in the world is beyond his skill

unpredicted helpers, miracles of time and space, further his project,
destiny itself(maiden) lends a hand and betrays a weak spot in the 
parental system. 

barriers, fetters, chasms, fronts of every kind dissolve before the 
authoritative presence of the hero.

eye of the ordained victor immediately perceives chink in every fortress
of circumstance, and his blow can cleave it wide
