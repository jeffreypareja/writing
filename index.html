    <h1>The Beginning</h1>
    <p>
        In the unending plane of existence there was nothing, until space suddenly appeared. Little did he know about
        the reason why he is in the plane, he just appeared instantaneously.
        There he continously roam the plane of existence searching for something he cannot tell. 
        He felt empty and searched for eternity something that will fill himself.
        He searched for the widths and lengths far from anyone that could ever imagine, yet none of these efforts returned anything for him.
