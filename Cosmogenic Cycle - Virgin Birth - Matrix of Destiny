the earth is just an empty place
god gave moon his wife which produced the grasses and plants
then god took his wife after 8 days
and he gave the moon another wife which produced livestocks
(eg. sheep, goats, chickens)  and humans
then moon slepth with humans with produced antoher humans
and they declared him the king
the wife slept and lived with snake
the moon laid with the wife, under the bed lay the snake, which
it bit the moon and made moon sick
after snake bit th emoon the plants withered
rivers and lakes died, animals died

his reaction but released itself and ran free.
