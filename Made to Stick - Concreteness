language is often abstract, but life is not abstract 
abstraction is bad
truth is especially sticky because of the way it was encoded
concrete images evoked by fable allowed its message to persist

avoid trap of abstraction

what makes something concrete 
    if you can examine something with your senses, its concrete
    v8 engine is concete, high performance is abstract

concrete language helps people, especially novices, understand new concept
to teach an idea to a room full of people, and you are'not certain what they
know, concreteness is the only language

using concreteness as a foundation for abstraction is not just good for matematical
instruction, it is  a basic principle of understanding 

novices crave concreteness

concreteness helps us understand, construct higher, more abstract insights on building
blocks of our existing knowledge and perceptions

abstraction demands some concrete foundation


concrete ideas are easier to remember

velcro theory of memory
memory is like velcro, you can see that one is covered with thousands of tiny hooks
and other is covered with thousands of tiny loops, when press two sides together
a huge number of hooks get snagged inside loops, thats what causes velcro to seal


find a universal language that everyone speaks fluently, that universal language will be 
concrete

concreteness makes targets transparent

eg boeing goals
727 must seat 1313 passengers, fly nonstop from Miamo to new york city, and land on runway 
4-22 at laguardia

rather than best passenger plane in the world

exercise 1 write white things
exercise 2 write white things inside ref

abstract idea to concrete with intense sensory experience

concreteness is way of mobilizing and focusing your brain

prop works better than scientific description

concreteness is perhaps the easiest to embrace, 
it may be also be the most effective of traits
barrier is simply forgetfulness
