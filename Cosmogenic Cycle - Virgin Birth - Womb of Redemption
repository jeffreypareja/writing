Cosmogenic Cycle - Virgin Birth - Womb of Redemption

world of human life is now the problem
grandlines of human comedy are lost in the sea of cross-purposes
men's perspective become, flat and comprehending only the light
reflecting, tangible surfaces of existence
society lapses into mistake and disaster 

people yearn for some personality in a world of twisted body
and souls, will represent again lines of incarnate image
we are familiar with myth from our own tradition that
occurs everywhere

eg. would be the herod figure(extreme symbol of misgoverning, 
tenacious ego) has brought mankind to nadir of spiritual 
humiliation, occult forces begins to move. 
in an inconspicous village maid is born who will maintain
herself pure from fashionable errors of her generation
a miniature in midst of men of the cosmic woman who was the 
bride of the wind. her womb, remaining fallow as primordial
abyss, summons to itself by its very readiness the original 
power that fertilized teh void.
