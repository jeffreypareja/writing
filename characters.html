    <h2>
        Universe
    </h2>
    <p>
        Universe is the space itself in the universe, therefore he can manage the space of anything inside him. He can
        make matters move, change it in size, and destroy it. He already existed right before time existed. He
        is currently working with time, without time, the universe cannot proceed of what it needs to do in him.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Entity
    </h2>
    <p>
        Rebelled against the universe, he is the epitome of creation(little did he know about it) after space destroyed
        him his fragments(creative essence and sentience) continue to roam the universe. (Is he already dead? I'll find out)
    </p>
    <h2>
        Time
    </h2>
    <p>
        Has been with space for a long time, at the time of destruction time embraced space before the plane of
        existence destroyed therefore time covered the universe after the destruction just like it embraced it at the
        beginning.
