Cinematic Technique means the methods and practices we use to add additional layers of meaning,
nuance and emotional context to shots and scenes in addition to their objective content.

Lens is a tool in achieving this means.

setting frame is series of choices which decide what viewer will see or not see.
first choice is where to place camera in relation to scene.
after that there are choices concerning field of vision and movement 
all of them works together to influence how audience interpret the shot both in 
context and emotional undercurrent and subtext to action and dialog.

static frame
    proscenium
    action of scene is presented as stage show and we are 3rd person observer.
    there is proscenium wall between us and action which is especially true if 
    everthing else about frame is normal(eg. lens, level, no movement etc)
    can be a useful tool which carries own baggage and implications of POV and world view

foreground/midground/background
    we are projecting 3d space into 2d plane. our job is to reinvent the depth that existed in 
    original scene or manipulate it in a way that serves purpose of the scene
    basic rule of camera position and staging is that importance of object should equal its size in frame


lens perspective

    wide lenses and expansion of space 
        first decision is where the camera is in relation to subject
        once that decided how much view is to be included 

        normal human vision extends to around 180deg
        foveal vision for perceiving details is around 40
        in 35mm film 50mm is considered normal lens equivalent to 25mm in 16mm film
        something around 40mm is closer to typical vision

        with wider than normal lens  depth perception is exaggerated(objects are farther aprt) than reality

        exaggerated sense of depth has some psychological implications,
        all this can give viewer sense of presence

        give viewer sense of presence

        another aspect of wider lenses is that given distance and fstop they have greateer depth of field
        greater depth of field allows more of scene to be infocus

    deep focus
        deep focus facilitates  composition in depth to an unprecedented degree

    compression of space(long lenses)
        these are very long lenses, they have effects that  opposite of wide lenses, compress space, less depth of field
        and deemphasize movement away and toward the camera

        compression of space can be used for perceptual purposes
            claustrophobic tightness of space, making distance objects seem closer and heigtening intensity of the action and movement 
            ability to decrease apparent distance has many uses both in composition but also creating psychological space

            effect of having objects seem closer together than they really are is often used for making stunts and fight scenes more
            dramatic and dangerous than they really are

            with careful camera placement and lens, speeding bus can seem to miss child on bicycle by inches 


        can be used to isolate character in space
            even though background and foreground objects are closer they are drastically out of focus
            can result in detached  3rd person pov of the shot
            detachement is reinforced to the fact that compression of space makes more tangible feeling real world is projected onto flat plane
            therefore we perceive it as 2d representation

        movement of long lenses is not as dynamic therefore more abstracted
        it is more of idea of movement than perception of actual movement

        effective with actors running towards us
        shooting with widelens and slow motin has ultimate effect of making move seem faster and more exaggerated than reality

    there can be no real suspense unless audience knows what is going to happen
    manipulating perspective
        there are many tricks that can be used to alter audience's perspective
    selecting focus
        characteristic of relative lack of dof can be used for selective focus shots
        shallow depth of field can isolate subject
        focus is an important storytelling tool

        selective focus and out of focus can also be highly subjective visual metaphors for influence of drugs or madness

        basic rules
            focus goes to person speaking
            focus goes to person facing camera or most prominent in frame
            focus goes to person experiencing most dramatic/emotional moment 

image control

    filtration
        modern lenses are sharp but we want soft images sometimes
    
    soft lenses
        subtly soft
        can give sligthly great dof

    flare/glare
        direct hit of light creates flare/glare
    frame rate
        high speed produce dreamlike effect, can be used for dramatic effect
        low speed is used on comedic effect
    slow speed blur

    shutter angle
        more closed shutter more sharper image
        changes in shutter nagle can be used in conjunctin with strobe lighting
    time lapse
    lens height
        dialog and most ordinary people shots are done at eye level 
    
    high angle
        we seem to dominate subject
        usefull if intent is establishing or expository shot
    low angle
        little is revealed beyond what character see
        we share character's surprise or mystery
        subject tends to dominate us
        if subject is character he will seem powerful and dominant
    
    tilt
        we strive camera for perfect level
        it is a must to recheck everytime the camera to see and ensure that it is still on the bubble
        that is crucial because human perception is much more sensitive to off-level criticals than
        off level horizontals
        if camera is even little off even vertical lines will be immediately seen as out of plumb
        however we can utilize this if we want visual tension of this off level condition to work for us 
        to create anxiety, paranoia, subjugation or mystery
    
    reveal
        what audience cannot see can be as important as what the audience see
        camera positions and perspective may be chosen which deliberately obscure some key object or character until filmmaker chose to show it.
        is often accomplished with camera move
    camera movement
        camera movement associated with first or second person pov is very involving and engaging 
        we are drawn in because  we constantly strive to reorient and "place" ourselves in scene
        as movement is disorienting our brain is engaged to try to keep us oriented
        to keep up with movement and figure out where we are and what is going on becomes interactive.
        should always be goal that journey from opening frame to ending frame be visually interesting and challenging along the way
        if it becomes to jumping from one frame to another, use cut

        in pacing, rapid and erratic camera movements suggest energy or restlessness or chaos, especially in conjunction with rapid cutting

        just because you can doesnt mean you should

        dont make mistake of substituting useless trick for carefully thinking about visually effect and cinematic meaning of framing, lens 
        choice and camera choreography
