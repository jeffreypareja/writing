along with sequential editing, ability to move camera  is fundamental aspect which distinguishes film and video 
from photography, painting and other visual arts

most basic use of camrea is where to place it

motivation and invisible technique
    camera movement must be motivated
    camera movment itself may have purpose
    unmotivated camrea moves and zooms are distracting

basic techniques, pan and tilt

types of moves
    pan - left to right horizontal movement where camera position does not chagne
        general rule of thumb with shutter opening at 180 and rate of 24fps object should take 5 seconds to move from one side of frame to other
    tilt up/down
        much less used
    move in/ move out
        move dolly toward or away from action
        moving into scene or out of it are ways of combining wide shot of scene with specific tighter shot,
        it is a way of selecting view for audience in way that is more dramatic than just cutting from wide to close shot
        it has effect of focusing viewers attention even more effectively than just wide shot then cutting it 
    zoom
        optical change of focal length 
        not popular with feature film making, but almost video work is done in zooms
        when it is used it must be motivated
    punch in
        different for pushin
        longer focal length prime is put on or lens is zoomed in for tighter shot
        commonly used for coverage on dialog scene

moving shots
    tracking    
        most clearly motivated to track along with character or vehicle in same direction
        most part, movement is alongside and parallel
    countermove
    reveal
        subject fills frame, then something else is revealed
        most effect when second frame reveals new content which amplifies meaning of first shot or ironically comments on it
    circles
        very specific use is dolly completely or halfway around subject 
        as it is quite common to use circle track to move very slowly around subject in tightshot. focus pulling can be quite complex
        to simplify circle is to place the subject at the dead center of radius
    crane moves
        ability to achieve large vertical moves within shot 
        most basic variety is to start with high angle then focus on the geography most often with character doing something
        starting tight on the scene then pulling back to reveal wide shots is effective way to end scene and often used dramatic last shot of film
        depending on content it can be powerful
        the ability of the crane to swoop dramatically and flowingly can be used for exhilarating and energetic effect more than any type of camera move
        most of them are capable of going down below level of mounting surface
    rolling shot 
        wherever camera is mounted  on vehicle either on picture vehicle or camera car which travels along with pic vehicle
        pic vehicle is one being photographed
