essence of cinema is like guiding 3 blind men's hands to the elephant that they touches

cinematic technique is very much about setting up questions and expectations in audience's mind
it is manipulating shots and sequence in a way that sets up these questions and expectations that 
distinguishes 'shooting' from cinema.

setting up questions in the audience's mind is what keeps them involved in the story

building blocks of scenes

number of shots which are building blocks of film grammar
    wide shots
        encompasses an entire scens
        establishing shot is usually a wide shot
        establishing georgraphy is most important within the scene
    full shots
        a shot which includes all of the subject, whether can be a person or a thing
    medium
        relative to subject, closer than wide shot eg. someone buying a soda
        being closer into action thatn we were in wide, we can see people's expression, details of hwo they are dresssed
        we just become involved in what they are viewing without focusing on one specific character or particular detail
        whenever possible, we should see character's entrance
    two shot
         any frame which include two characters,
         interaction between two characters in scene is one of fundamental pieces of storytelling thus two shot is one you will 
         use frequently

    cut away
        any shot of some person or thing in scene other than characters we are covering but still related to scene
    reaction shot
        type of cut away shot
    
    insert
        isolated, self-contained piece of larger scene. eg. she is reading a book and we shoot book from shoulder
            practical inserts -  as is the headlines on newspaper or name of file being pulled from drawer, mostly informational
            emphasis inserts- usually closely connected to main action but not absolutely essential to it. eg. coffee cup jolts as he pounds table
    
    connecting shot
        anytime scene includes people or objects that cannot be framed in same shot at some point in scene, use connecting shot
        its all about keeping audience in scene in a way that they don't get lost or confused   
    head and shoulder
    big head
    cowboy
    tight two
    dirty single
    clean single


    invisible techniques - audience are rarely aware of them
        master - entire scene including all elements usually done as one continuous take
        coverage - consists of mediums, close ups, ots, inserts and cut aways needed
            when shooting dialog scene with two or more people, ots and close ups will alwyas come in sets, 
            they  must match the shot they are answering
    
    it is often best to transition in and out of scene
    another way of transitioning into scene is to start with empty frame and have them enter

    let characters both enter frame and exit frame 

    it is always best to start with widest shots and move in


hitchcock's rule
    size of an object in frame should equal its importance in story at the moment
