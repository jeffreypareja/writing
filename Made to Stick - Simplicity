Simplicity

finding core of the idea

2 steps in in making ideas sticky
find the core, and translate core using SUCCESS checklist

finding core  
    commanders intent
    elegance and prioritization, not dumbing down
    finding a good lead(the meat of story, often found
    out in first sentences of news article)
    
    dont burry the lead, dont start with something 
    interesting but irrelevant in hopes of entertaining
    audience. Instead work to make core message itself
    more interesting

    finding core isnt synonymous with communicating core

    simple = core + compact

    great simple ideas have elegance and utility that make them function
    a lot like proverbs.
    simple ideas: short sentence drawn from long experience 
    the simple we are chasing isnt sound but but a proverb: compact and core

    compact ideas help people learn and remember a core message.
    they maybe even more important when it comes time to help people
    act properly, particularly in an environment where they have to make 
    lots of choices
    
    messages have to be compact, because we can learn and remember only
    so much information at one.

    ideas with profound compactness are valuable
    use flags, tap existing memory terrain of your audience, use
    whats already there

    stick a flag to a concept that many already know
    make it easier to learn new concept by tying it to a concept that 
    you already know.

    schema is collection of generic properties of concept or category
    schema consist of lots of prerecorded information stored in our memories
    
    schemas help us create complex messages from simple materials
    use of schemas can sometimes involve a somewhat slower truth to 
    real truth

    if a message can't be used to make predictions or decisions, it 
    is without value, no matter how accurate or comprehensive it is 

    accuracy to the point of useless is bad
    
    great way to avoid useless accuracy is to use analogies
    analogies derive power from schemas 
    analogies make it possible to understand a compact message because
    they invoke concepts that you already know
    good analogy can wield a lot of power

    proverbs tap the power of analogy, by invoking the schemas 
    that already exist

    some analogies are so useful that they don't merely shed light on 
    a concept, they actually become platforms for novel thinking.

    good metaphors are generative, they generate new perceptions,
    explanations, and inventions

    many sticky ideas are actually generative metaphors in disguise

    eg. idea of disney that everyone are cast members

    generative metaphors and proverbs both derive their power from a 
    clever subtitution, they substitute something easy to think about 
    for something difficult.

    proverbs are holy grail of simplicty

    finding core and expressing it in the form of compact idea can be 
    enduringly powerful.
