cognitive secret: 
    brain summons past memories to evaluate whats happening in the moment 
    in order to make sense of it 

story
    foreshadowing, flashbacks, and subpots must instantly give readerse insight 
    into what's happening in the main storyline, even if the meaning shifts as the 
    story unfolds


weave in relevant elements of the past, ongoing auxiiary storylines and hints of future, 
whether subplots, flashbacks or foreshadowing.

every subplot/flashback must in someway affect the story question, in a way reader 
can see in the moment.


subplots
    story without subplots tends to be 1 dimensional
    gives stories depth, meaning, and resonance in myriad ways
    they can complicate the storyline
    they can provide "why" behind protagonists actions
    show things happening concurrently

pacing is length of time between moments of conflict
conflict is what drives story forward, and often mounting anticipation of it has readers
so engrossed they forget to breath

set pace so each burst of intense confict in main storyline, each sudden sprint, each 
unexpected twist, is fueled by the information and insight thats been building since 
previous twist.

each time conflict peaks, back off a bit to give reader time to take it in, process it, 
and speculate on its implications

subplots invite reader to leave recent conflict behind for a moment and venture down 
a side road that he believes will lead back to story in near future.

not all subplots directly affect protagonist, their purpose is to give protagonist 
necessary insight

all subplots must earn their keep by giving us information we need to know, 
factual, psychological or logistical

3 ways a subplot can do its job

supply information that affects whats happening in the main storyline
make protagonist quest that much harder
tell us something that deepens our understanding of protagonist

just make it on time

never use a flashback poorly
back story is everything happened before story began 
flashback stops the main storyline, weaving in backstory doesn't


only reason to go into flashback is that without it what happens next wont make sense
we must have a pretty good sense of why we ned this information now

when flashback ends, information it provided must immediately and necessarily 
affect how we see story from that point on

checkpoints
    do all your subplots afect protagonist, eithter externally or internally as he struggles
    with story question? 
    
    when you leap into a subplot or flashback, can reader sense why it was necessary 
    at that very moment? 

    when returning to main storyline, will your reader see things with new eyes from 
    that moment on?
        new insight of what's going on
    
    when protagonist does something out of character, has it been forshadowed? 

    have you given your reader enough informatioon to understand what's happening?
