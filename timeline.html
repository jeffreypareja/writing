        space just existed before in the plane of existence
        and then time appeared
        after a long time they shared the moments together, they knew each others characteristics, weakness and
        strength. (they learned that they cannot live without each other)
        long after then entity was formed and appeared on the plane of existence.
        entity just went along with space and time.
        they learned that entity can create things, space can manage them, and time's ability is unknown.
        time and space fell in love with each other, giving birth to `light` 
        entity became jealous of time, because she seems useless
        entity tried to kill the family, space fought with entity
        space killed entity by compressing him
        killing entity did an explosion
        plane of existence destroyed, killed the family too
        the explosion resulted as space expanded and became the universe and it continues to expand continously , light roamed the space, time
        covering the
        space
        the entity(creative essence and sentience)'s fragments (<a href="fragments.html">Please see the kinds of
            fragments from the entity</a>) roamed the universe,
        some of the fragments became the clouds and stars in which universe organize them in systems. <a
            href="universe-organization.html">how universe make a system</a>
        creative essence and sentience too cannot be manipulated by universe
