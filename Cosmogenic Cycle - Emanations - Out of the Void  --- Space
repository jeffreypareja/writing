Cosmogenic Cycle Out of the Void --- Space

The basic principle of all mythology is this of beginning 
in the end. 

creation myths are pervaded with sense of doom that is continually
recalling all created shapes to imperishable out of which 
they first emerged. 

Forms go forth powerfully, but inevitably reach their apogee, 
break and return. 

mythology in this sense, is tragic in its view in the sense that 
it places our true being not in the forms that shatter  but 
in the imperishable out of which they again immediately bubble
forth, mythology is eminently untragical.

as in dream, images range from sublime ridiculous 
mind is not permitted to rest with its normal evaluations,
but continually insulted and shocked out of assurance that 
now it has understood. 
mythology is defeated when mind rests solemnly with its 
favorite or traditional images, defending them as though they
themselves were the message that they communicate. 
those images are regarded as no more than anything. 

first phase of cosmogenic cycle describes breaking of formless-
ness into form, just like creation chant of Maoris of New Zealand

Space

in space two existence without shape appeared
moisture - male
great expanse of heaven - female

from those sprang
the heavens - male
earth - female

those two were the parent of the gods

10th of those series is night
18th is space/ether, frame of the visible world
19th is male/female polarity
20th is universe we see

such series suggest depth beyond depth of the mystery of being

hebrew cabala represented process of creation as series of 
emanations out of the great face, where the world we see is the
reverse image of cosmic tree

according to Indian Samkhya philosophers the void condenses
into the element ether or space, from those air is precipitated
from air comes fire
from fire water
and from water the element earth
with each element eveolves sense function capable of perceiving
it: hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell 

chinese myth personifies emanating elements as five venerable 
sages who come stepping out of a ball of chaos that is suspended
in the void

first is yellow ancient, master of earth
second was red ancient, master of fire
3rd was dark ancient, master of water
4th is wood prince, master of wood
5th is called metal mother, mistress of metals
