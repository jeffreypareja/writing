Return: The Magic Flight

if (hero wins blessings of goddess)
    explicitly commissioned to return to world with some elixir for
    restoration of society, 
    fianl stage is supported by all powers of his supernatural patron

else if(trophy attained against opposition of its guardian or
    his wish to return to world that has been resented by gods/demons)
    last stage would be lively, comical pursuit. 
    maybe complicated by marels of magical obstruction and evasion

popular variety of magic flight is that in which objects are left behind
to speak for the fugitive and thus delay the pursuit

eg. the man escaping with his sons instructed huts, clumps of trees,
filth dump, and temple of hill to answer for him when his wife should
return and call, delaying the chase of the woman seeing the man with 
sons at the canoe which was a mere speck on horizon when she hastened
into temple

another well known variety is on in which number of delaying obstacles
are tossed behind by the wildly fleeing hero. 

myths of failyre touch us with tragedy of life, those of success only
with their own incredibility

if monomyth is to fulfill its promise, not human failure/superhuman 
success but human success is what shall have to be shown.
that is problem of crisis of the threshold of the return, we shall
consider it in superhuman symbols and then seek practical teaching for
historic man
