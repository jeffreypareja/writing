filming is shooting for editorial
shooting is not for shooting great shots but serve purpose of film by giving editor and 
director what they need to actually piece together completed scenes and sequences which 
adds up to produc that accomplishes its purpose

4 categories of continuity
    content     
        applies to anything visible in screen
        it is the script supervisor in conjunction with various departmetns heads who must ensure that all items match from shot to shot
    movement
        anything that is moving in a shot must have a movement in next shot which is a seamless continuation of what was begun
        movement must have no gaps from one shot to next (whether opening door, picking book, parking car)
        overlap all movement
    position
        most problematic with props
    time
        has to do with flow of time within scene
        internally within scene certain conventions help maintain pacing and flow particularly in cases when character moves in the scene

        in boo technique of film and video editing 
            used by kurosawa
            tight close up of character that tracks/pans as character moves 
            as long as direction, action and speed match that of wideshot, movement of character can be either shorter or longer 
            than realtime it would take

            if character changes direction, than that must be preserved when cutting to wide shot


prime directive
    to not create confusion in the mind of the audiencce and thus distract them from story or annoy them

action line
    there is imaginary axis on/between moving objects
    eg. moving car has linear axis if we stay on one side of it everything cuts correctly

    basic rule is not cross it

what establishes the line
    line exists once it has been created by something in the scene
    
    several things can establish line for scene 
        a look
        movement
        specific action
        exiting frame 
        physical geography
    180 deg rule - once that camera is placed on the side of the line, you can move it around anywhere in 180deg area and shots will cut together

screen direction
    gives audience clues about story 
    keeps audience from getting confused about where someone is or what they are doing

directional conventions
    classic example is on lowbudget cowboy movies 
    it is well established one direction was to town and other is away from town 

exceptions to rule of the line
    if we see things change position in the shot
    camera position moves during the shot
    you cut away to something completely different, when you cut back you can change the line

    neutral shot is where movement is either directly towards or away from camera. the line itself has moved
    line can change throughout the scene

    if we cross line without confusing audience its ok  

    reverse
        another is when you deliberately go to the other side for a reason
    turnaround
        we would never do ots on actor then move camera to ots of another actor then goback and so on and so on
        so naturally we do all coverage on one side and move camera reset lighting 

Preplanning coverage
    whenever you are setting master, take a moment to think about the coverage
    particularly if one character coverage is more dramatic or more crucial to the story than other

cuttability
    when we put sequence together it is important that when one shot follows another, it is smooth, not jarringly
    the shot must change by 20% to be cuttable(just an estimate)
        can be 20% change in angle, lens size, or camera position

other issues in continuity

if there is clear connection between two and directionality is very strong then it is good idea to maintain directional continuity between the two

covering a curving walk
    can be easy to figure out just use 180deg rule

turning a corner
    if camera cuts when character disappears around corner of bulding, when we pick him up on the oter side screen direction should be maintained

entering and exiting frame
    exiting frame establishes directions
    once character exits either left or right they should enter in the opposite side

neutral axis to exit frame
    if moving vehicle/person exits on neutral axis then you are free to go anywhere you want for nex tcut


three shots with dominant character
    if you break it up as pair of two shots, person will center will appear in both shots 
    and there will be unavoidable continuity problems, 
    center character will pop as you cut from shot from shot

keep the nose out 
    it is important to avoid getting a part of foreground person in shot when doing clean single
    over shoulder of second character

eye sweeps 
    when off screen character walks behind camera, screen character may follow with her eyes    
    which is ok as long as eye sweep is slightly above or below lens
    it is importnat for actor not to look at camera

group shots
    scenese with more than 3 characters reuqire a good deal of coverage 
    if there is dominant direction to arrangement of group that will most likely dictate a screen direction line based on where you shoot your master
    it may be possible to shoot from almost anywhere as long as you get proper answering shots
    and coverage
    it may be better to pick arbitrary line and stick to it, this will reduce audience percepiton
    dominant character often establish the line

chase scenes
    maintain overall direction within scene but there is considerable room for variation
    when chase itself change direction, screen direction may change as well

converging action/parallel cutting
    two opposing forces are moving toward each other, visual tension and pacing should intensify

cutaway eyeline continuity
    since cutaways are not part of main scene but are physically related to it, directional continuity
    must be maintained between location of scene and cutaway element 
    especially important for cutaways that involve look from additional charater
    since often it is the look that is importnat, eyeline direction is crucial

look establishes new line
    when actor lok at someone a new line that establishes a new line which must be respsected in all shots
    which involve couple at table and another

eyelines in ots coverage
    whne shooting ots normally camera height will be at eye level
    if two performers are of unequal height, some modification is usually necessary

eyelines for seated character
    same principle applies when one or more of characters is seated or on the floor
    but with an important exception
    shooting over the shoulder of standing char might be an extreme angle, it also works
    to keep camera at eye level of seated performer

ots and inserts
    inserts are not crucial generally in terms of screen direction except in a general way
    it is still important to conform to the eyeline and screen direction of character reading material
    
moving action
    once you thoroughly understand underlying principles and cognitive reasons for these rules
    it easier to see when there are exceptions and flexibility

    in highly frenetic fight scene the editor and director may ignore the line to add disorientation
    otherwise audience might end up rooting for wrong guy


introductions

    four basic introductions that need to  be made
        place 
            where they are
            important exception to wide shots on this is called slow disclosure where
            scene begins with tight shot of character or scene element
            as scene progresses does the camera pull back to reveal where we are and what
            is going on
        time
            viewer must know when we are
        geography
            establishing geography relates to scene itself, particularly but not exclusively, hte interiors
        and main character
            mostly function script and actors but general principle is to introduce 
            key characters in some way that visually underlines some aspectof their importants, nature and story function

    many aspect of introduction and tansitions are functions of script but they need to be 
    actualized by cinematographers and directors at the set
    some are improvised at shooting


6 types of cuts
    content cut
        cut a shot within new scene to add new information or carry story forward
        just part of overall forward progression of narrative 
    action cut/continuity/movement
        action is started in one shot and finished in next
        always shoot in overlap
        if close shots continue the action in larger shot, it also match the speed of the action

        cutting on action
            cut on action
            if someoneis seated at desk and rises to go to door, shoot while he is rising from chair
    pov cut
        the look
        most fundamental building blocks of continuity
        valuable for cheating shots and establishing physical relaitonships
        
        direction of look and angle of pov must match and bear some relationship
    match cut
        transitional device between scenes
        they imply deep connection to scenes or past events

        ceiling fan of the saigon hotel to spinning blades of helicopter
        using element in previous scene to match the next cut
        
    conceptual cut
        from bone to spacecraft 
        mainly directed by script 
    zero cut
        rarely gets mentioned in discussion of shooting and editing
        action scenes
        used to stitch together two shots to make one
        in ronin one shot is in la and seamlessly cut to austria
