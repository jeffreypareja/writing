what makes people believe ideas? 
start with obvious
because our parents or our friends of parents believe
we've had experience that led us to our beliefs
becuase of our religious faith 
because we trust authorities 

well those are powerful forces 

authorities are reliable source of credibility for our ideas.
when we think of authorities who can add credibility, 
we tend to think two kinds fo people 

first is expert: scientists
second are celebrities and other aspirational figures 

canwe find external sources of credibility that don't involve 
celebrities or experts? yes

we can tap credibility of anti-authorities 

eg. laffin that is a smoker 
    dennis that is a homeless

commercial claiming that new shampoo makes your hair bouncier has less credibility 
than hearing your best friend rave about how a new shampoo made her own hair bouncier

honesty and trustworthiness, not status that allows them to act as authorities
 
most of time our messages have to vouch for themselves.

persons knowledge of details is often a good proxy for her expertise

think how history buff can quickly establish her credibility by telling an interesting
civil war anecdote

but concrete details don't just lend credibility to authorities who provide them,
they lend credibility to idea itself.

by making a claim tangible and concrete, details make it seem more real, more believable
details makes credibility of an idea
vivid detials boosts redibility, we also need to make use of truthful core details 
we need to identify details that are compelling and human, but more meaningful, details that
symbolize and support our core idea

use of vivid details is one way to create internal credibility -- to weave source of 
credibility into the idea itself, another way is to use statistics

but its more important for people to remember the relationship than number

another way to bring statistics to life is to contextualize them in terms that are more
human, more everyday 
statistics arent helpful, its the scale and context that make them so
statistics are good source of internal credibility when they are used to illustrate
relationships 
when it comes to statistics, best advice is to use them as input, not output
use them to make up your mind on an issue, don't make up your mind and then go 
looking for the numbers to support yourself 

if we use statistics to help us make up our minds, we'll be in a great pisition to 
share the pivotal numbers with others.  

eg
yu are likely to drown on a beach in an area protected by lifeguard than attacked by 
shark. 12 people dieed in lifeguard protected areas, they were no fatalities from sharks

hard statistics, many people may think drownig is common cause of death, which make it
not seem like right comparison to make.
statistics provided isnt vivid or meaningful on human scale

improved version would be 

which of these animals is more likely to kill you? 
    shark  or a deer

a dear is more likely to kill you, its 300 times more likely to kill you

unexpected idea that deer is more dangerous than evil shark, followed by 
doubly unexpected statistic that bambi is wildly more dangerous(300 times)
also taps into audience as source of credibility, people in audience knows how 
much they fear deer when driving around


we can make our ideas more credibly on their own by using compelling details or by using 
statistics

pass sinatra test, if I go there I go anywhere

another one point would be a "testifiable credential" by wendy's burger, they made a 
falsifiable claim
the message doesnt draw on external credibility, didnt invite authorities or anti-authorities
it doesnt draw on internal credibility like "11 percent more beef", instead wendy outsourced
credibility to its customers

testable credentials can provide an enormous credibility boost, since they essentially allow
your audience members to try before you buy

testable credentials can backfire -- see for yourself step can be valid, while 
resulting conclusion can be entirely invalid.

testable credentials are useful in many domains eg. ronald regans question "are you 
better off now than you were four years ago" 

another example would be nba's lessons about hiv 

how do we get people to believe our ideas?

we got to find source of credibility to draw on.
modelling a testable credential works

most obvious sources of crediiblity -- external validation and statistics aren't always 
the best 

few vivid details might be more persuasive than a barrage of statistics 
anti-authority might work better than an authority
single story that passes sinatra test might overcome a mountain of skepticism
