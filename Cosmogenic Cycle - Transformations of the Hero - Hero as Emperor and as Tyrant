Cosmogenic Cycle - Hero as Emperor and as Tyrant

hero of action is agent of the cycle, continuing into the living
moment the impulse that first moved the world. 


supreme hero is not the one who merely continues the dynamics of 
the cosmogonic round, but he who reopens the eye - so that through
all the comings and goings, delights and agonies of world panorama, 
One Presence will be seen again. 

this requires deeper wisdom than the other, and results in a pattern
not of action but of significant representation. 

characteristic adventure of first is the winning of bride, bride is 
life.

second is going to father -- father is the invisible unknown. 

where the goal of hero's effort is the discovery of the unknown father,
the basic symbolism remains that of the tests and the self-revealing way

the hero blessed by the father returns to represent the father among
men, from his presence boons go out, his word is the wind of life. 

but a deterioration may take place in the character of the representative
of the father. 

no longer referring the boons of his reign to their transcendent source, 
the emperor breaks the stereoptic vision which it is his role to 
sustanin. 

he is no longer mediator between the two worlds. Man's perspective
flattens to include only the human term of the equation, and the 
experience of a supernatural power immediately fails.

upholding idea of community is lost. force is all that binds it
emperor becomes the tyrant-ogres, the usurper from whome the world is
now to be saved.
