Stories are told and retold because they contain wisdom
Stories illustrate causal relationships that people hand't recognized
before and highlight unexpected, resourceful ways in which people have solved problems.

story's power is two fold
    provides simulation (knowledge about how to act)
    inspiration (motivation)

note that simulation and inspiration are geared to generating action

credible idea makes people believe
emotional idea makes people care 
right stories make people act

story is part entertainment and part instruction 

example stories arent simply transferring nuggets of information
there is something more profound happened

stories are strongly associated with entertainment
being audience seems like passive role
passive maybe overstating case
when we read books, we have sensation of being drawin into the author's world

what if stories involve us in less intuitive, more dramatic ways? 

there is a researched idea suggesting that line between story's audience and 
story's protagonist may be a bit blurry

researchers studied participants that are divided in two groups

first would read a story which critical object was associated with main character in story

"john put on the jacket" 

second would read story which critical object was separated from main character

"john took off his sweatshirt before jogging" 

strange is people who thought john took off sweatshirt before jog took more time to 
read sentence thatn people who thought john had it on

it implies we create a geographic simulation of stories we hear 

we cannot simply visualize story in movie screen in our heads, we must somehow simulate it
complete with some analogue to the spatial relationships described in the story

when we hear story, our midns move from room to room, when we hear story we simulate it 

there are 3 groups in research conducted
control group
event simulation group
outcome-simulation group

event simulation group did better 

why does mental simulation work? because we can't imagin events or sequences without 
evoking same modules of brain that evoked in real physical activity.

mental simulations help us manage emotions

surprisingly mental simulation can also build skills

right kind of story is simulation
stories are like flight simulators for brain

the more that training simulates actions we must take in theworld, the more effective 
it will be 

story is powerful because it provides context missing from abstract provides

role that stories play -- putting knowledge into framework that is more lifelike,
more true to our day-to-day existence 
more like a flight simulator

we don't always have to create sticky idease
spotting them is often easier and more useful


there are 3 basic plots
challenge,
    david and goliath, underdog story, rags to riches, triumph of sheer will power over adversity
    key elemet is that obstacle seem daunting to protagonist
    they are inspiring even when they're much less dramatic and historical
    they inspire us by appealing to our perseverance and overcome obstacles
    they want us to work harder, tkae on new challenges, overcome obstacles
    hcallenge plots inspire us to act
connection, 
    good samaritan
    its a story about people who develop a relationship that bridges a gap, racial, class,
    ethnic, religious, demographic or otherwise
    doesn't have to deal with life and death stakes as does good samaritan
    fabulous for romance, (romeo and juliet)
    it inspire us in social ways
    they make us want to help others, more tolerant of others, work wth others
    love others

    all about relationships with other people
creativity
    involves someone making a mental breakthrough solving a long standing puszel, or 
    attacking problem in innovative way 
    creative plots make us want to do something different

goal of those examples is to learn how to spot stories that have potntial
know what you're looking for, dont need to make stuff 

eg. denning story when he was in world bank

wrote  abook called springboard 
defined that springboard story as a story that lets people see how an existing problem 
might change, springboard stories tell people about possibilities

major advantage is that they combat skepticism and create buyin
when you hit listeners between eyes they respond by fighting back

the way you deliver a message to them is a cue how they should react 
with story, you engage audience, you are involving people with idea, asking them to 
participate with you

when it comes to engaging "little voice inside head" 
work in harmony with it, engage it by giving it something to do

he wrote an insightbook called the springboard
springboard stories mobilize people to act,
spring board storries go beyond having us problem solve for main character
telling stories with visible goals and barrier shifts the audience into problem solving mode
sprinboard story helps us problem solve for our selfves
it is an exercise in mass cutomization

stories can almost single-handedly defeat curse of knowledge
they naturally embody most of success frameowkr.

hardest part of using stories effectively is making sure that they're simple, that they
reflect your core message
stories have amazing dual power to simulate and to inspire 
msot of time we don't even have to use much creativity to harness these powers- 
we just need to be ready to spot the good ones that life generates everyday
