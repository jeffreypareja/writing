Framed Ink: Drawing and Composition for Visual Storytellers
Frame is not just picture
frame is an information

we want information to be organized in particular way, this is thorugh composition
through composition we are telling the audience where to look, what to look and in what order to look at it

good composition reinforces the way in which mind organizes information
composition selects and emphasizes elements such as size, shape, order, dominance, hiearchy, pattern,
resonance, and discordance in ways which gives meaning to the things being photographed that goes
beyond simple.

design principles

unity - visual organization be a whole, self contained and complete
balance - every element has visual weight 
visual tension - interplay of balanced and unbalanced elements can create visual tension
rhythm - rhythm of repetitive patterns can create patterns of organization
proportion 
contrast - function of light/dark value, color and texture of the objects in frame and the lighting
    an important visual component in defining depth, spatial relationships and of course carries considerable
    emotional and storytelling weight
texture - if we can perceive its texture it means that it is closer to subject
directionality - everything has some element of directionality
    directionality is a key element to visual weight


3 dimensional field
    big part of what we do is creating 3d world out of 2d images 

    depth - we are often trying to create perception of depth within what is actually flat space 
        there are number of ways to create depth

        - overlap
            establishes front/back relationships. something in front of another thing is closer to the observer
        - size change(relative size)
            although eye can be tricked, relative size of an object is an important visual cue to depth
            relative size is key component of many optical illusion and key compositional element in manipualting viewer's perspective
        - vertical location
            gravity is factor in visual organization, relative vertical position of objects is depth cue
        - horizontal location(left/right)
            largely result of cultural conditioning, eye tends to scan from left to right 
        - linear perspective
            it is important to recognize its importance in visual organization
        - foreshortening
            since things that are closer to eye appear larger than those farther away, when part of object is much closer than the rest
            visual distortion gives us clue as to depth and size
        - chiaroscuro(gradations of light and dark)
            establishes depth perception and creates visual focus, since we deal with light this is an important consideration in our work
        - atmospheric perspective
            objects that are great distance away will have less detail, less saturated than those that are closer

forces of visual organization
    all of these basic elements can be deployed in various combination to create hiearchy of perception: 
    they can create organization of visual field which makes composition coherent and guides eye and brain as it puts information together
    which can include

    line
        explicity or not is constant in visual design
        powerful and multifaceted in its use
        just few lines can create perspective comprehensible by brain
    sinous line
        reverse S is constantly recurring theme in visual art that been used as compositional principle by classical greek artists
        it has distinctive harmony and balance on its own  
    compositional triangles
        they are everywhere
        they are fundamental tool in visual organization
    horizontals, verticals and diagonals
        basic lines are always factor in almost any type of compositions
    horizontal line and vanishing point
    power of edge: the frame
        we are subconsciously aware of frame itself. four edges have visual force all their own
        objects that are close to frame are visually asociated with it and viewed in relation to it more than if they are far away
        frame's field of forces exerts visual weight on the objects within frame and any grouping of elements in frame are affected by it
        even more as the objects/group of objcts are very close to or even overlapping edge
        frame also plays important role of making us aware of those spaces off frame 
    open frame 
        one or more of elements either pushes edges/crosses the edge
    closed frame
        the elements are comfortably contained within the frame
    frame within frame(framing in photography)
        sometimes composition demands frame different from aspect ratio of film
        especially important tool when working with wide format such as 2.35:1 or High Def
    balanced and unbalanced frame
        any composition may be balanced/unbalance and informal/formal
    positive and negative space
        visual weight of objects/line of force can create positive space, absence can create negative space
        negative space has visual depth as well
    movement in visual field
        depends on cultural factors
        western culture reads from left to right and top to bottom

film and video composition
    rule of thirds
    miscellaneous rules
        dont cut off feet on ankle
        when framing for important foreground subjects whether we include or not the heads of people is judgement call
        if they are prominent enough you can incude it in composition
        if not cut them at nose level
        if person not speaking you may cut him from the shoulder level

basic composition rules for people
    headroom
        too much headroom makes figure seem to be lost in frame
        as closeup gets bigger, its become permissible to leave even less headroom
        head shot cut above eyebrows seem normal, but shot that cuts chin would seem very odd

    noseroom(looking room)
        if character is turned to side, its as if gaze has certain visual weight
        if character turned to side, more noseroom is allowed
