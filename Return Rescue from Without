from without, world may have to come and get him. 

for the bliss of the deep home is not lightly abandoned in favor of 
self-scattering of the wakened state. 
yet so far as one is alive, life will call
society is jealous of those who remain away from it, and will come knocking
at the door. if hero is unwilling, disturbers suffers an ugly shock 
if summoned one is delayed -- sealed in by extreme blessedness of the 
state of perfect being, an apparent rescue is effected, and adventurer
