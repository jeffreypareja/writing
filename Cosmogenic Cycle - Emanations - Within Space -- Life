Cosmogenic Cycle - Within Space -- Life

first effect of cosmogenic emanations is the framing of world
stage of Space
2nd is production of life within the frame - life polarized 
for self-reproduction under the dual form of male and female, 
possibly represent process in sexual terms eg. pregnancy and 
birth. 


Paiore, high chieftain of Polenisian island of Anaa, drew picture 
of the beginnings of creation 

universe was like an egg contained "the foundation(male)" and  "
stratum rock(female)", that bursted and produced 3 layers, 
1 layer supported by male and female, who created man, animals 
and plants.

first man matata without arms died shortly
2nd man aitu with 1 arm an no legs died shortly
3rd man was hoatea and perfectlyform 
hoatu came and became a wife of hoatea and from them
descended the human race.


image of cosmic egg is known to many mythologies

not uncommon cosmig egg bursts to disclose, an awesome figure 
in human form. 

thus it appears that though these myths of creation narrate of 
the remotest past, they speak at the same time of present origin
of the individual.

according to mysticism of sexual love, ultimate experience of 
love is a realization that beneath illusion of two-ness dwells
identity

this realization can expand into discovery that beneath 
multitudinous individualities of whole surrounding universe -- 
human, animal, vegetable, even mineral -- dwells identity;
whereupon love experience becomes cosmmis, and beloved who first
opened the vision is magnified as the mirror of creation 
man or woman knowing this experience is possesed of what 
Schopenhaur called "science of beauty everywhere"
