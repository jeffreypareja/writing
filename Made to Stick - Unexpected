Unexpected

    First problem of communication is getting peoples attention
    we can't demand attention, we must demand it, which is a tougher challenge

    most basic way to get someone's attention is this: 
    break a pattern

    humans adapt incredibly quickly to consistent patterns
    we only consciously aware of these things only when something 
    change

    focus of this is how do I get people's attention and how to keep it
    surprise gets our attention
    some naturally sticky ideas propose surprising facts
    interest gets our attention
    there are classes of sitcky ideas that maintain our interest overtime

    isnt planned unexpectedness an oxymoron? 

    eg car commercial then crashed, which is an ad for seatbelts because
    we did not expect any car to be crashed in car commercial

    ad is unexpected because it violates our schema for neigborhood trips
    commercial reminds us that accidents are inherently unexpectedness
    
    our schemas are like guessing machines
    schemas help us predict what will happen and consequently, how we 
    should make decisions 

    emotions are elegantly tuned up to help us deal with critical 
    situations, they prepare us for different ways of acting and thinking

    surprise jolts us to attention
    surprise is triggered when our schemas fail, and it prepares us to 
    understand why failure occured
    when schema(guessing machines) fail, surprise grabs our attention
    so that we can repair them for the future

    surprise is associaetd with facial expression that is consistent
    across culture

    when brows go up, it widens our eyes and gives us a broader field 
    of vision -- surprise brow is our body's way of forcing us to see 
    more.

    when we are angry, our eyes narrow so that we can focus on a known
    problem

    surprise causes our jaws to drop and out mouths to gape 
    its as thoguh our bodies want to ensure that we're ont talking or 
    moving when we ought to be taking new information

    surprise acts as kind of emergency overriede when we confront 
    something unexpected and our guessing machines fail.

    unexpected ideas are more likely to stick because surprise makes
    us pay attention and think
    surprise gets our attention
    sometimes attention is fleeting, in other cases surprise can
    lead to enduring attention
    surprise can prompt us to hunt for underlying causes, to imagine
    other possibilities, to figure out how to avoid surprises in future

    surprise makes us want to find an answer -- to resolve the big
    question of why we were surprised -- and big surprises call for 
    big answers

    if we want to motivate people to pay attention, we should seize 
    the power of big surprises

    going for a big surprise can cause big problem

    using surprise in service of core message can be extremely powerful
    surprise isnt enough, we also need insight 
    surprise must be 'post-dictable'
    twist makes sense after you think about it, but its not something
    you would have seen coming

    PHRAUG is post-dictable, HENSION isnt

    emotion of surprise is designed to focus our attention on the failure
    so that we can improve, then we drew a distinction between gimmicky
    surprise, and meaningful post-dictable surprise

    if you want ideas to be stickier, you've got to break someone's
    guessing machine and fix it
    easiest way to avoid gimmicky surprise and ensure that unexpected
    ideas produce insight is to make sure you target an aspect of
    audience guessing machines that relates to your core message


    good process to make ideas stickier is 
    identify central message you need to communicate -- find core

    figure our whats counterintuitive about message ie. what are 
    the unexpected conclusion that can be drawn unexpectedly from
    core message? why isnt it already 
    happening naturally? --- eg break common sense

    communicate message in a way that breaks audience guessing machine
    along the critical counterintuitive dimension,

    once guessing machines have failed, help them refine their machines

    best way to get peoples attention is to break their existing 
    schemas directly


    how do we get people's attention and how do we keep it

    most of our unexpected ideas represent relatively simple, quick
    adjustments to a model. 

    they may be profound but they happen rapidly, so they only need 
    people's attention for a short time

    sometimes though our messages are more complex, how do we get 
    people to stick with us through a more complex message?

    mysteries are powerful, they create a need for closure
    aha! experience is much more satisfying when its preceded by huh?
    experience

    by creating mystery, writer-astronomer made dust interesting, and
    sustained attention, not just for a span of a punch line but for 
    the span of 20 page article 

    prvious example just contradic and refined the schema in short
    period of time.

    mysteries act differently, it is not created not from unexpected 
    moment but from an unexpected journey

    we know where we're headed -- we want to solve the mystery -- 
    but we're not sure how we'll get there

    schema violation is one time transaction, but mystery is more 
    unexpected and subtle, thats a second level unexpected ness 

    this way we jump from fleeting surprise to enduring interest

    curiosity is intellectual need to answer question and close open
    patterns, story plays to this universal desire by doing opposite, 
    posing questions and opening situation

    curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge
    we need to open gaps before we close them

    first though they must realize that they need these facts, 
    trick to convincing people that they need our message, is to
    first highlight some specific knowledge that they're missing
    
    we can pose a question or puzzle that confronts people with a 
    gap in their knowledge 

    we can point out that someone else knows something they don'to

    we can present them with situations that have unknown resolutions

    we can challenge them to predict an outcome(which creats 2, what
    will happen, and was I right)

    they work because they tease you with something you don't know,
    something you didnt care about, until you found that you didn't know 
    it.

    to hold people's interest, we can use a gap theory of curiosity 
    to our advantage

    to make our communications more effective,  we need to shift
    our thinking from 
        'what information do I need to convey?' to 
        'what questions do I want my audience to ask?'

    our gap theory relies on our ability to point out things that people
    don't know. one complication is that people tend to thik they know
    a lot.  

    overconfident people are more likely to recognize a knowledge gap 
    when they realize that others disagree with the

    as we gain information we are mroe and more likley to focus on 
    what we don't know.

    some topics naturally highlight taps in our knowledge 

    curiosity comes from gaps in our knowledge, but what if there's
    not much knowledge to begin with? 

    give people enough context about the game so that they'd start to 
    care

    set context and give people enough backstory that they start 
    to care about the gaps in their knowledge

    the only way to get people care is to provide context

    knowledge gaps create interest, to prove that knowledge gaps exist
    it may be necessary to highlight some knowledge first

    "here's what you know, now here's what you're missing'

    "i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the 
    goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and 
    returning him safely to the earth, if we make this judgement 
    affirmatively, it will not be one man going to the moon, it will 
    be an enture nation, for all of us msut work to put him there"

    unexpected idea, create surprise, it create insight, 
    rather than leading us along a plodding route from one incremental
    step to the next, the ideas give us a sudden dramatic glimps of how
    to world might unfold, and not just how but why

    unexpectedness, in services of core principles, can have 
    surprising longevity.
